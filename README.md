# Learning Materials
All work in this repo is from me learning various subjects. The work is either copies of standards or online tutorials, or it is coursework or personal work, stored here for me to learn both git and whatever material is here.

I claim no license for the work done in this repo. If the file is a copy of a standard or an online tutorial, I note the source. If the file is coursework or something I'm playing around with, it is noted as such.

By the way, some people use tabs, and some people use spaces. I use tabs. I prefer to. Some things about tabs are annoying, like viewing some of my files from github.com. Oh well, I still prefer tabs.
