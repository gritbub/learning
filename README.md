# Learning Materials
All work done in this repo is for my learning. The work is either copies of standards or online tutorials, or it is coursework or personal work, stored here for me to learn both git and the material contained within.

I claim no credit for the work done in this repo. If the file is a copy of a standard or an online tutorial, I note the source. If the file is coursework or something I'm playing around with, it is noted as such.
